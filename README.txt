Answers:
• What did you do in this lab?  
          I learned how to use the computer and PICkit to run a simple C program. In addition, I learnt the fundamentals of the C programming language.
• What mistakes did you make, and how did you identify and solve them? 
          I made multiple mistakes when it came to connecting Kit to my PC. I can simply print "Hello world" in MPLAB X, but when I copy it to the PICkit3, it displays strange characters. Then I went over all of the handouts again and realized I didn't set the Baudrate to the correct rate. This lab became a breeze for me once I solved this challenge.
• Do you have any feedback for us about this lab?
          I think it's a fun Lab that introduces me to a simple embedded system and the C programming language. Instead of reading tedious textbooks, I learnt basic concepts through practice.
